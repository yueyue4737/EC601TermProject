Feedback from my project
==

Time Series Analysis
--
<p> It cannot be accomplished by Snorkel. The feedback comes from a phd student, white male, perhaps a TA in 521. <p>

Multitask learning
--

<p> Multitask learning might not be so difficult in some field, according to a recent graduate master. <p>

Other group's project
===

<p>1. I found the project about tulong in the quiz, at first I didn't get the meaning in Chinese.
   2. A network analysis, using maltego in cyber security is made by student in another coruse.
   3. My teamates in another group made a very interesting project about audio analysis.
   4. It is important not to confuse the concept of machine learning, i.e, supervised vs unsupervised.<p>
